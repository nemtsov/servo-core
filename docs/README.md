#Setup Documentation [WIP]

Currently the setup requires a few manual steps. These setup docs will assume you are using `us-east-1` which will be `virginia` in the servo world. This setup does require that you are familar with AWS as it focuses heavily on setting up the required AWS resources. 

_***NOTE***_: Servo can be used in an existing account, however it will have the permissions to many AWS resources. If this a concern, consider running this in a separate AWS account.
