#S3 Buckets

Servo uses S3 to store information about builds/notifications/etc. It will create subfolders, however the initial bucket will need to be created manually. Servo searches for the s3 buckets based on the base handle and prefix resulting in a bucket like: `[PREFIX]-[ORG]-[REGION]`.

Currently, the prefix is `servo`, which needs to be fixed?

For example: Given a `BASE_HANDLE` environment variable of `alpha:virginia`, servo will try to find an S3 bucket whose name is `servo-alpha-virginia`.

When standing up a new org or region, the bucket needs to be manually created before you attempt deploys.
